# PHP CRUD

This is the fourth assignment for first year Fullstack Web Developer students at Chas Academy.

## Assignment

Using HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL create a To-do app with CRUD-functionality.
This assignment also includes the use of PDO.

### Criteria

- PHP, HTML and CSS with connection to SQL-database with a table for tasks

- Each task should have:

  - A unique ID
  - A title
  - A task description
  - Ability to be marked completed

- User must be able to:

  - Show al
  - Add a task
  - Edit a task
  - Delete a task
  - Mark a task as completed

- All changes must be saved in the database

- Basic design for task list and forms using CSS
  However, this assignment does not focus on design, functionality is the priority.

- At least one HTML-form that uses PHP for creating and editing tasks

### Additional functionality added (optional)

- Marking all tasks as completed

- Deleting all marked tasks

## Comments

/functions/connect.php contains connection to the database using PDO.

table-setup.sql contains SQL for creating the table used in this project once database is connected.

### Challenges

This project introduced me to PHP, PDO, SQL and Docker.

It has been a lot to grasp at once but I find these hands-on assignments to be a great learning opportunity.
